# In-Hospital-Mortality-Prediction
Patients with major health complications or life-threatening diseases are frequently admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) for adequate treatment and care. When a patient is suffering from a medical condition, they may exhibit a variety of indications and symptoms. These include individual procedures, laboratory tests, internal health assessments, fluid balance, records, and measures of vital signs and symptoms. If any aspect is deteriorating, it is critical to seek immediate medical attention. It is critical to recognize the symptoms that are most likely to endanger the patient's life as soon as possible. If the patientâ€™s symptoms are identified in a timely manner, quick medical attention and care can help to lower the odds of mortality. However, monitoring these patterns becomes tedious when done manually. Technology-assisted disease diagnosis is now possible thanks to the recent advances in machine learning. In this project, four classification and regression techniques are implemented and compared for identifying patients nearing death. The algorithm having the most accuracy is implemented to classify the mortally endangered patients and the leading symptoms of death are also identified.
